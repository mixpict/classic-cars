<p>Martin and Barbara have now run the company since 2001. There are single-point fuel injection systems that introduce gasoline into a throttle body mixed with air. As the float falls with the outflow of fuel from the inner chamber the valve mechanism is again actuated and the process repeated. A carburetor relies on the vacuum created by the engine to draw air and fuel into the cylinders. Test the vacuum fuel pump output by disconnecting the output hose from the carburetor and placing it in a suitable container to collect the.</p>

<p>The Vacuum that a motor produces comes from the intake strokeof the motor where the crankshaftdraws down the pistonand air is pulled or sucked into the motor. The throttle can open and close allowing either more or less air to enter the engine. We service all models of Autovac for both cars and commercial vehicles. This air moves through a narrow opening called a venturi. Prepping The Gas Tank Fuel System Ecu Wiring For Efi.</p>

<p>This system was used for so long because of the simplicity behind it. Manifold vacuum pressure is highest with the throttle plates are closed and the vehicle is idling. A carburetor relies on the vacuum created by the engine to draw air and fuel into the cylinders. He designed and manufactured the Autovac as a means of delivering fuel from rear mounted tanks without the need for pressurisation.

<p>The fixed-jet carburettor resembles the simpler variable-jet type See How variable-jet carburettors work in having a venturi - a constricted neck - through which air flows on its way to the engine. This system was used for so long because of the simplicity behind it. The partial vacuum caused by increased air speed through the venturi sucks fuel through a jet to mix with the air. The suction valve shuts and the air valve opens destroying the vacuum and allowing the fuel to fall past the drop valve into the outer chamber and thence to the carburettor by gravity.

The suction valve shuts and the air valve opens destroying the vacuum and allowing the fuel to fall past the drop valve into the outer chamber and thence to the carburettor by gravity.

<p>Remember that the vacuum system gravity feeds gasoline from a vertical height of only about 10 to 15 inches down to the carburetor inlet. The suction valve shuts and the air valve opens destroying the vacuum and allowing the fuel to fall past the drop valve into the outer chamber and thence to the carburettor by gravity.
