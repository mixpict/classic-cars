<p>Collector Harry Blomberg put his prized collection of automobiles on display in 1966 in the old Biltmore Industries Building in Grovewood Village adjacent to the Omni Grove Park Inn. The museum is home to several antique and vintage automobiles that Harry and his dealership had come to own over time. The Antique Car Museum is located with the Homespun Museum in the little village behind the Grove Park Inn. Almost half of the cars are vintage 1920s models.
