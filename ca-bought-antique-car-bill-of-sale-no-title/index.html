<p>I bought a car a few months back its a truck from 1962 its been on non OP for about 10 years still in the system. I only have a bill of sale no title. My title certificate doesnt have the amount I paid. The registration process of an out-of-state vehicle in California requires VIN verification whether or not the car has a title and even a current registration outside of California.
