<p><strong>How To Choose Engine Oil Viscosity For Antique Car</strong>, Motor oils specifically blended for vintage cars often will contain a ZDDP additive. Be careful of knock-offs that look similar. The numbers are commonly assigned in ranges of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50. This oil had the cold viscosity of one single grade oil and the hot viscosity of another.</p>

<p>Just chose the correct viscosity. Thin low viscosity oils flow easier to protect engine parts at cold temperature. In this case 5W-30. Most motor oils viscosity is rated based on how thick it is at zero degrees Fahrenheit represented by the number preceding the W which stands winter as well as its thickness at.</p>

<p>Higher viscosity grades have more resistance to flow than lower viscosity grades. Engines that run low oil temps require. Well get to viscosity in a minute Sometimes the manufacturer will apply a small decal somewhere under the bonnet that lists the brand and grade of oil that is appropriate for that car.

<p>For example motor oil displaying 20w50 simply told us that the oil performed like a 20w single grade when cold and a 50w single grade when hot. This oil had the cold viscosity of one single grade oil and the hot viscosity of another. A multigrade oil is better than a single grade because the single grade oil tend to be too thin at higher temperatures. Engines that run high operating oil temperatures require higher viscosity oil.

<p>The thing is that engine oil goes in different viscosity grades that define how thick oil is and its fluidity. A Texaco oil expert advised me to use 20W-50 in my Hupmobile 1929 and 10w-40 in my other prewar cars. Just chose the correct viscosity.
