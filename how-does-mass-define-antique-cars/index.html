<p>On an antique car the odometer reading is important because in many states an antique car does not have to be inspected for safety or for emissions if it is operated less than X number of miles per year.

<p>I have my insurance through Grundy as well. However some items like cars for example are often called antique because so few of them are over 100 years old.
