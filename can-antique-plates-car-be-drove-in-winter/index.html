Legally youre not allowed to take the plates off one vehicle you own and put them on to another that doesnt have plates - even for just a quick drive from the lot. While its common knowledge that you have to follow your states DMV regulations for your vehicle not everyone is aware of the fact that recently-purchased vehicles are often an exception. Not a plate under the seat they cant see to associate with the car andor owner. 12 6k Likes 81 Comments Porsche Club Porscheclub On Instagram Winter Sunday Photo Via Rue965 Classic Porsche Bmw Classic Cars Classic Cars.</p>

<p>I cant believe any cop would disagree. The owner is responsible for keeping a log of the miles driven for personal use each calendar year. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. Unfortunately this is not legal.

<p>Vehicles displaying these plates during the months of April-October may be driven on the highways without being subject to the restrictions of a standard antique vehicle plate. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation.

<p>I dont know about NJ but down here in Texas you can register a car as an antique with the correct year plates. Running you plate even though you arent doing anything wrong is key to finding stolen cars plates criminals and such. Fortunately a trip to a rust-proofing shop can put these concerns at bay and you can even do the deed yourself with the right equipment. They should expect that the 1966 plate on the 66 car is the pate they will see in the records. Pin On Dry Lakes.</p>
