<p>The classification criteria vary but consensus within any country is often. A vintage car is in the most general sense an old automobile and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. The Classic Car Club of America states that it refers to vehicles built between 1925 and 1942. Yet in many states you can register a car as an antique or a historic car after 20-25 years.
