<p>It is not legal for felons to own modern guns in Texas nor is it legal to sell them guns. In the state of Texas curio and antique guns manufactured before 1899 that do not use centerfire or rimfire ammunition are not considered firearms under the Texas Penal Code Title 10 Chapter 46. According to Texas state law a vehicle will be considered an antique if the body frame and engine are at least 25 years old. Vehicles registered as Antiques are exempt from annual inspection.
