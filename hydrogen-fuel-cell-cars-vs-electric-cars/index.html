There are now more ev charging locations than gas stations in the uk Electric vehicles can run on either rechargeable batteries or fuel cells that convert hydrogen into electricity. In fact, evs may just be the transition from fossil fuel to fuel cell electric. At the last count, buyers had a choice of about 80 electric models, in a variety of bodystyles and prices.</p>

<p>Each fuel cell contains oxygen and hydrogen, and it can produce power for an indefinite amount of time. The initial cost of gas vehicles is a great deal lower, although the price of gas increases that cost over the life of the vehicle. The fuel that an electric car runs on is electricity (which is used to charge the batteries) and the fuel that a hydrogen fuel cell car runs on is hydrogen (which is used to generate electricity). Both electric and hydrogen cars lack internal combustion engines and run on electricity instead of petrol or diesel. Hydrogen is blowing up From science experiment to export.</p>
