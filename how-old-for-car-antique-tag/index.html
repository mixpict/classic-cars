<p>Vehicles which are 35 years old and have been made into street rods andor hot rods are no longer antique vehicles. This really means that the vehicle has to be at least 26 years old. For instance antique car registration documents are available for vehicles that were manufactured prior to 1981. If youre considering getting antique plates for your classic car you car needs to be at least 25 30 years old.

<p>The Antique Auto Club of America says the definition of what constitutes an antique vehicle has changed over the years. The application states the vehicle must be older than 25 years old. If you own a passenger vehicle trailer semi-trailer or motorcycle with a model year that is more than 25 model years old before January 1 of the current calendar year youve got an antique. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.
