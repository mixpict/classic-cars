<p>The cost of extracting hydrogen from water, using electrolysis with zero carbon emissions, is declining. The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen. As the mirai's tank holds approximately 5 kg, a full hydrogen refill would cost between £50 and £75 meaning that hydrogen fcevs are more expensive per distance able to travel than both internal combustion vehicles and bevs. The australian capital territory is poised to take delivery of the first of 20 hyundai nexo “fuel cell” cars early next year once the installation of its hydrogen refuelling station is complete.</p>
