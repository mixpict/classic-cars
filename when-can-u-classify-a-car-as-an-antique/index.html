<p>Antique car. Once they reach this age in those states cars can be classified an antique and in many cases for a fee can have a special license plate indicating its antique status.

<p>Yet in many states you can register a car as an antique or a historic car after 20-25 years. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently. Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique. If however you ask HMRC for a definition then its anything thats at least 15 years old and worth a minimum of 15000. Pin On Volkswagen.</p>
