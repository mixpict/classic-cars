<p>The definition of an antique is anything older than 100 years and it includes any item. As we mentioned above the Antique Auto Club of America says antique cars are those that are 25 years old or older. A classic vs antique car is easily confused but an antique car is older. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. Gallery Home Supercars Net Classic Cars Vintage Old Classic Cars Jaguar.</p>

<p>In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. Certain states have specific designations for antique vehicles deeming them historic as opposed to comparatively newer classic cars. Some automotive organisations may refer to a car made in the 1940s as a Classic while others my consider cars from the 1980s to Classics.
