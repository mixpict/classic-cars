<p><strong>Vroom Car Sales Tax</strong>, The state where you register the car is the one that charges the sales tax, not the state where you bought the car. If i fill out vroom’s financing application, do i have to actually finance through vroom? Yes, you must pay sales tax when you buy a used car if you live in a state that has sales tax. On top of any state sales tax, you'll need to add the county portion, if required, to know how.</p>

One thing to remember though is that you don't pay any tax with vroom, so when you transfer the registration, you're going to get hit with the tax for an out.</p>
