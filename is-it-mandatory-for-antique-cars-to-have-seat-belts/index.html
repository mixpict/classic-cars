<p>Many manufacturers offered seat belts as extras to the car. Requires all Vechicals 1900-2010 to Have Seat Belts. I think but have never been able to confirm that this exemption ceased in the early 70s and was not the intent of the law but it was circumventable if your vehicle could seat more than 10 and be classed as an bus. BTW wearing the seat belt has its own benefits. Legendary Dodge Coronet Super Bee Classic Cars Dodge Super Bee Super Cars.</p>

<p>If a classic car was originally manufactured without seat belts then it currently does not need to have seat belts fitted. Post 68 seat belts were mandatory in all seating positions except some types of sideways facing seats. In all cases where a seatbelt was fitted it was mandatory to wear it and have it. Seat belts are mandatory for vehicles registered after 1995 or make of 1995 and after. Pin By Beach Bitsh On Vrum Vrum.</p>
