<p>In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. Good luck with it. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. Some states though allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years while others require it to be older. 1938 Mg Va 4 Door Saloon 1548cc 4 Cylinder 54bhp Pushrod Ohv Engine Photo By Clay Antique Cars Classic Cars British Cars.</p>

<p>The Antique Automobile Club of America defines an antique car as over 25 years of age. If you get antique plates you can only drive the car limited number of miles and for limited purposes and you must have another car with regular plates that you use for regular use. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. Unfortunately there are people who have vehicles registered as antiques that are not obeying the laws. Mg Va Tickford Drophead Coupe 1939 8223 Coupe Family Car Morris Garages.</p>
