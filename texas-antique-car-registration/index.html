<p>So while the Antique Automobile Club of America says a classic car is one between 25 and 50 years old and the Classic Car Club of America says it is a car produced between 1925 and 1948 your state may have a completely different interpretation. Texas considers a custom or assembled vehicle as a motorized vehicle of any kind that has been reconstructed using a body frame and a motor. The difference is that it cannot resemble a known brand. If you want to drive it on a daily basis it can be registered as a Classic truck which will cost you 10 more or as a regular vehicle.
