<p>Oh and if the car being painted is a large 30s or 40s-era sedan a long station wagon or simply a full-size car from the 50s and 60s then two gallons of color will most certainly be needed and that adds considerably to the final cost. The prices we found ranged from 220000 to upwards of 1000000 with some higher than 3000000 depending on the car paint scheme trim and bodywork needed for that specific classic car or vehicle. Most of the cost comes from all the work to get ready to paint before the first container of paint is ever opened. Entire Oil cooler kit.

<p>The other 10 is in the painter and sliding him an extra 100 before they roll your car. A regular bodyshop will probably charge around 2500. Most of the cost comes from all the work to get ready to paint before the first container of paint is ever opened. If the shop does the work and you spec high end paints then you can be looking at the higher end of around 10000 for a really good paint job to 25000 for a really custom job.
