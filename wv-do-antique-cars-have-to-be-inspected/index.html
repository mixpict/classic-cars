<p>Antique vehicles meeting the requirements to be exempt from state inspection need not be examined by an official state inspector. A vehicle must be more than 25 years old to qualify for antique plates. Have a valid registration card and a current certificate of insurance in the vehicle at the time of inspection.

<p>Drivers may also have the option to apply for the use of WV antique license plates and utilize their antique car for general transportation only if they satisfy DMV-imposed criteria including passing an annual safety inspection or using license plates that have been registered to the specific vehicle and inspected and authorized by the department among other requirements. On an antique car the odometer reading is important because in many states an antique car does not have to be inspected for safety or for emissions if it is operated less than X number of miles per year. Any vehicle purchased or otherwise acquired within West Virginia not having a valid inspection sticker must be inspected within three days. All antique vehicle plates expire on July 1st.
