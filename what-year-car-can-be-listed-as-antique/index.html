<p>Our motor tax laws define a vintage car as one thats 30 or more years old. So while the Antique Automobile Club of America says a classic car is one between 25 and 50 years old and the Classic Car Club of America says it is a car produced between 1925 and 1948 your state may have a completely different interpretation. Antique cars also should be kept in as close to their original design and specifications as possible. Antique auto means an automobile or truck manufactured in or after model year 1916 that is more than 25 years old.
