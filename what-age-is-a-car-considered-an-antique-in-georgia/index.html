<p>Antique vehicle registration is open to anything older than 25 years but the restrictions are well defined. Also certain things need that designation to indicate age &ndash; a clock for instance may have been made exactly the same way for 30 years but if yours came on the market in 1970 it. For a car to be considered a classic it must be more than 20 years old in good condition and true to the original design.

<p>Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique. Once they reach this age in those states cars can be classified an antique and in many cases for a fee can have a special license plate indicating its antique status. This leads us to the word Collectible. A car must be at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car.
