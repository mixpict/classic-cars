For example a Hot Wheel toy car may be worth 10 but another car of the same design but with different color goes for over 300.</p>

<p>Toy vehicles have existed almost as long as vehicles themselves but it was the car that really broke out as a favourite. While the first toy cars were cast iron models the era between the wars saw a move to pressed steel followed by diecast cars in the post-war era. There are plenty of notable examples from the 80s and 90s but one decade that doesnt get talked about all. The Dinky Toys company produced miniature diecast toys from the 1930s until the 1970s. These toys are unique and limited in number so finding high quality rare items on eBay is a matter of regularly surfing around the different country locations on our website.</p>
