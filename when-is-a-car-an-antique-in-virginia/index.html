<p>This is a Free event for Car and Motorcycle enthusiasts of all ages. The state puts limitations on the use of antique vehicles which must be at least 25 years old with antique plates. Once they reach this age in those states cars can be classified an antique and in many cases for a fee can have a special license plate indicating its antique status. Whether or not your car is considered an antique depends on who youre asking and what state you live in. .</p>
