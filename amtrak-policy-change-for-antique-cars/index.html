<p>So Amtrak didnt change the rules on you after your booking in April of 07. The guidelines say Amtrak will only accommodate private car moves at endpoint terminals or intermediate stations where the scheduled dwell time is sufficient to allow switching of the cars. No fee for unreserved tickets. The new meals will allow an expansion of traditional meal hours and allow for in-room delivery for sleeping car passengers.
