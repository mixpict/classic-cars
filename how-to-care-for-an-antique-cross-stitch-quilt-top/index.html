It is better to use a very similar color as the top fabric usually a tone lighter or darker than the fabric is used to make the quilting stitches. This will also get rid of some of the musty smell that the piece has acquired while in storage. You want to keep them as white as possible but using harsh bleach and soap can damage the fibers.
