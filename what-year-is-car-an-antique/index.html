<p>Generally cars that are considered Vintage were manufactured between the years of 1919 and 1930 but some end it at 1925. Technically an early 1980s Honda would qualify for antique plates. Generally speaking if the item is no older than an antique but not less than 20 years it falls under the term vintage. A good place to look is with state DMVs.

<p>I have heard the term true vintage as being at least 50 years old. For example in Rhode Island a car is considered an antique if it is at least 25 years old. Without a clear cut definition how do we decide. Generally speaking if the item is no older than an antique but not less than 20 years it falls under the term vintage.
