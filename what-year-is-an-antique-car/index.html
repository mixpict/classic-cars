<p>I define vintage as 20-40 years old and antique as older than 40 years oldbut clearly it is item specific eg radios cars etc. A motor vehicle that is at least 25 years old can be lawfully imported into the US. The vehicle should be roadworthy the body should have no rust the interior should be intact without tears in the upholstery flooring or header. For example in Rhode Island a car is considered an antique if it is at least 25 years old. Ac Six Year 1920 1929 Front Antique Cars Vintage Cars Picture.</p>

Any car that is 25 years old or older used to qualify for an antique license plate which requires a one time 7 registration fee. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation. Auto Hobby Page Car Pics Retro Cars Classic Cars Duesenberg Car.</p>
