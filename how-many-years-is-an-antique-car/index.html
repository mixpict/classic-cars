<p>The state issues antique licenses to cars that have a manufacturing date closer to 1900 than the current year. Antique cars are over 45 years old and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930. An antique vehicle adds Greer is generally at least 30 years old which is the minimum age for historic or vintage plates in many provinces. Overall I find this state to be lenient on vintage car ownership We searched high and low on the DMVs website and couldnt find any exemption for titles regardless of year.

For insurance and registration purposes the age of a classic car in most cases is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. The one exception is Oregon. Cars older than 25 years have antique status which means no safety inspections and registration renewals spaced out to either 3- or 5-year intervals.
