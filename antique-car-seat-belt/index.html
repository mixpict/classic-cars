<p>A fine of up to 500 can be given to a driver or passenger for violating the seat belt laws. This week we have a couple questions about kids in vintage cars. Section 10 provides an exemption for drivers and passengers from wearing a seat belt if a motor vehicle was manufactured without seat belt assemblies for each seating position and the vehicle. All of our seat belts meet Federal Motor Safety Standards FMVSS 209 and 302 standards. 1956 Classic Car Ad 56 New Ford Victoria V 8 Little Bear Cartoon 011918 Ebay Classic Cars Little Bear Cartoon Classic Car Photoshoot.</p>
