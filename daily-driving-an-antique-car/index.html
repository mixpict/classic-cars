<p>As new vehicle design becomes homogenous thanks to strict regulations the allure of driving a vintage car becomes quite tempting. The original pony car doesnt have the power of its younger siblings but its a sporty fun drive. You should be able to find a good-condition 1966 Mustang for about 9100 to 26600. As a long time VW fan I would absolutely recommend the Karmann Ghia.</p>

<p>The question is more one of whether or not you should daily drive your classic. My soon-to-be daily driver vintage car is a 1967 Plymouth Barracuda with a Big Block 383 shoe horned into the engine bay. Emissions are only required in Cumberland County basically in Portland and only for cars. Theyre very comfortable in traffic a blast to drive in.
