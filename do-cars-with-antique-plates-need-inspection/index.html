<p>Antique vehicles meeting the requirements to be exempt from state inspection need not be examined by an official state inspector. Antique vehicles operated exclusively between sunrise and sunset are exempt from the normal lighting requirements of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code but must have their original lighting equipment. The fees for antique vehicles depend on whether or not you apply for a title only or a title and. Drivers may also have the option to apply for the use of WV antique license plates and utilize their antique car for general transportation only if they satisfy DMV-imposed criteria including passing an annual safety inspection or using license plates that have been registered to the specific vehicle and inspected and authorized by the department among other requirements.

<p>The car must pass an initial state inspection but is exempt from inspection after that. You do have to go through inspections but not the annual registration. There is a 2250 title fee for this change. We do have the self inspected rule for vehicles sporting Antique plates. Pin On How About A Cadillac.</p>
