<p><strong>Leaded Gas In Ct For Antique Cars</strong>, This allows moist air into the tank which gets absorbed by the ethanol in the gas separates out as water accumulates at the bottom of the tank and causes running problems and rust in the tank. It protected vale seats in cast iron heads from Valve Sea. By the turn of the century less than 10 per cent of all cars in Britain will need leaded petrol and it may not be as widely available as it is today. Actually lead was put into gas to raise the octane rating.</p>

<p>The lead compound added to leaded petrol was cheap and it was an easy way to raise the octane rating on fuel which older cars engines need to run. Most of the time the lean fuel mixtures were the result of vacuum leaks from vacuum lines and intake manifolds. This allows moist air into the tank which gets absorbed by the ethanol in the gas separates out as water accumulates at the bottom of the tank and causes running problems and rust in the tank. Specialist high-performance cars need 100-octane fuels but they could get by on 97-octane leaded and even Lead Replacement Petrol LRP which until it was phased out contained other metal.
