Unless your car is a very old classic car then its unlikely your vehicle wont have seat belts. By 1968 the legislators corrected their oversight and required seat belts for all seating positions and added shoulder harnesses for the front seats. Children over 3 are only allowed to sit in the back seats. Volvo 220 1963 Volvo Amazon Volvo Volvo Cars.</p>

<p>Seat belts are not required for any 2a Landrovers but if fitted should not be removed must be in good condition and must be used if fitted. Section 106 HTA requires drivers and passengers to occupy a seating position in a motor vehicle as opposed to sitting in the cargo area of a van and wear the complete seatbelt assembly. I found it all by searching google. With all of that in mind lets take a look at Arizonas seat belt laws to make sure you know exactly what is expected of you. Pin On Cool Cars.</p>

<p>Unless your car is a very old classic car then its unlikely your vehicle wont have seat belts. As a seat belt manufacturer we can make seatbelts to fit old Chevys Fords Mopar British Imports Porches and many many more. 55 ears ago I rode in a small car in a test of seat belts at my Air Force Base. You can register your vehicle as an antique and pay a reduced fee but that only entitles you to drive your vehicle in parades and to shows.
