However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.

For instance many DMVs define a classic car as any vehicle over 15-25 years old and the Classic Car club of American defines classic cars as a fine or distinctive automobile either American or foreign built produced between 1925 and 1948.</p>
