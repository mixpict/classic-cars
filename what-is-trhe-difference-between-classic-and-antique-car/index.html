<p>If however you ask HMRC for a definition then its anything thats at least 15 years old and worth a minimum of 15000. When an owner decides to modify their vehicle it is usually to comply with emissions standards incorporate safety features such as airbags brakes or in some cases GPS systems. That it is old.

<p>Certain states have specific designations for antique vehicles deeming them historic as opposed to comparatively newer. Ask a random selection of insurance providers and theyll probably all tell you something different. The vehicle must be classed as a Historic and you purchase the Historic tags.
