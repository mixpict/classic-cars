When the park opens in April guests will enjoy the new feel of the Coney Mall where the Kings Mills Antique Autos will call their new home across from Juke Box Diner and adjacent to The Racer. Guests must be a minimum of 48 tall to ride alone OR be accompanied by a Supervising Companion. Opened in 1972 Kings Island has been recognized as one of the most notable seasonal theme parks in the United States and is home to several record breaking coasters including The Beast and Banshee.
