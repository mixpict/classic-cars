<p><strong>Electric Cars Benefits Environment</strong>, Since the global realization of the negative effect of traditional industrial technologies on environment and climate, sincere development has occurred in the field of innovative, environmental friendly technologies. Carbon dioxide emissions from traditional vehicles contribute to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and. Fueling with electricity offers some advantages not available in conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. They produce little or no tailpipe emissions, reduce dependence on petroleum and also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and health effects from air pollution, depending on the source of electricity used to charge them and other factors.</p>

<p>Many countries provide subsidies and tax incentives for the purchase of electric cars, since it’s believed electric vehicles have various benefits. Because electric motors react quickly, evs are very responsive and have very good torque. Separate to this, a study by transport and environment also supports the belief that electric cars produce less greenhouse gas emissions when compared to diesel engines. Realistically, we’d need everyone to switch to electric cars to see a reduction in co2 levels and while this may be doable in the future, it’s unlikely to happen now. There are numerous environmental benefits of electric cars;</p>
