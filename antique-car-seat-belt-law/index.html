<p>The law dictates that a child younger than six years old or one that weighs less than 60 pounds must be secure in a booster or child safety seat in a vintage or classic vehicle. Before 1966 there were no federal laws governing safety equipment in vehicles until the Highway Safety Act of 1966 which required mandatory safety equipment such as seat belts installed in most automobiles starting January 1 1968. Requires all Vechicals 1900-2010 to Have Seat Belts. Klief Guenther of the Wyoming Highway Patrol said you are not required to install safety belts if the vehicle was not made with them.
