<p>Jet A-1 for turbine engines and Avgas for spark ignition piston engines. You can expect a massive boost in performance. AvGas is a good gasoline for low speed aircraft engines that run at 2700 to 2800 RPM at 10000 feet or higher. The main reason for higher octane is so the fuel doesnt pre-ignite under the higher pressures of modern engines.

<p>Jet A-1 for turbine engines and Avgas for spark ignition piston engines. Lead Replacement is specifically designed for use in classic and vintage cars and should be used in every tank to maintain your cars performance and protect vulnerable components like valve seals. It has that high lead content to cool the exhaust valves in aircraft engines which do periodically run lean due to rapid altitude chages in flight.

AvGas is a good gasoline for low speed aircraft engines that run at 2700 to 2800 RPM at 10000 feet or higher. Buying a higher octane for a 20-50K motor is the cheapest insurance available. I am looking into purchasing a 1969 Mach 1 that has a 429 cobra jet engine in it. Please Click For Lightbox View In 2021 Car Fuel Aviation Fuel Drag Cars.</p>
