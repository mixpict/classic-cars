<p>We are now in an era where homes have more than one car. My next door neighbor frequently parks more than 2-6 cars in their driveway the cul-de-sac and now one car is frequently parking in front of my home on the curb of my property line. Hi I have asked this to my insurance company before and they confirmed the car. It is perfectly legal to park outside someones house unless the vehicle is blocking a driveway or a wheel is over a dropped kerb. Failing that park one of your cars outside your house that way he cant park the van there.</p>
