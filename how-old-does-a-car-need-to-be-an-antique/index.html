<p>And some classifications overlap between classics and antiques. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently.

They believe that items over 50 years old should be considered an antique. Pin By Thomas Bukowick On Old Classic Cars Classic Cars Antique Cars Vintage Cars.</p>
