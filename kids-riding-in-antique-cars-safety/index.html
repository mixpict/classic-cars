<p>The remote control gives parents full control of the car you can teach them how to drive until they learn to do it themselves. Law applies to all motor vehicles originally equipped with factory-installed seat belts. When traveling with your child in a vehicle it is the law in Connecticut to keep your child properly restrained in a car seat. Never place a rear-facing car seat in front of an air bag.

<p>Thanks in part to Professor Aldmans work Swedish children began riding rear-facing since the mid-1960s. While CVC 27315 exempts adults from having to wear seat belts in vintage cars and trucks it does not exempt children from wearing them. All children under 3 years old must use an appropriate child restraint when travelling in any car or goods vehicle except in the rear of a taxi if a child seat is not available. Violations of the Child Passenger Safety Act will cost you a 60 fine plus court costs. Macchina Triciclo Color Argento Strepitosa Toys Toy Car Ride On Toys.</p>
