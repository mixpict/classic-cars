<p>Chapter 2 is officially live. Long before fortnite season 3, fans were clamoring about the addition of cars to the game, and, despite the expectation that they would appear in the july 21 game update, there seems to be a slight delay. Fortnite chapter 2, season 3 is here after a long wait, and one of the biggest questions is if gamers will be able to drive cars. However, considering how the last five or more fortnite seasons have seen significant extensions, don’t be surprised at all to see season 3 also getting delayed.
