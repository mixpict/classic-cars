<p>Is your car 15 years or older. Under the new state law the owner of an antique or classic motor vehicle may apply for a vintage registration plate from the model year of the motor vehicle.

The vehicle must be in the good original condition meaning it was like that it is like when it left the factory. 1948 Tucker Torpedo Aaca Museum Hershey Pa Cars Trucks Classic Cars Old Cars.</p>
