<p>No case is too complicated. Its all very well to allow a claim on a repaired car which is sold at a loss but can it be reasonable to claim if you have not sold the car yet. If the vehicle was somehow classified as Salvage meaning it was meant to be destroyed or parted out or if the car was stolen you obviously dont want anything to do with it. You would not have to report this to the IRS. Rusted Old Green Car 1024x678 Antique Cars Car Wallpapers Hybrid Car.</p>

<p>For example if your car has an adjusted basis of 5000 and you sell the car for 6000 you have a gain of 1000. However the IRS prohibits taxpayers from claiming any personal losses on their tax return. So if you bought the car for 14000 and sold it for 8000 you would have a capitol loss of 6000. If the vehicle was somehow classified as Salvage meaning it was meant to be destroyed or parted out or if the car was stolen you obviously dont want anything to do with it. 1933 Lincoln Ka Convertible American Classic Cars Classic Cars Vintage Antique Cars.</p>
