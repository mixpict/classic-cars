<p>If you have not previously registered the vehicle in Texas you must submit ownership evidence proof of insurance if applicable and the applicable fees before the license plate or plate tab can be issued. When the next year rolls around or the year after that you dont have to worry about going back to the DMV or paying a large sum to re-register your vehicle. Please contact your local municipal office for additional information. Registering a vehicle as an Antique stipulates that it must be driven explicitly for exhibitions.
