<p>Everyone loves to see the car and thinks you are cool for driving an old car. Makes commuting more of an adventure. There is nothing stopping you provided the classic car in question is compliant with current road rules and regulations and you are able to have it insured to drive on the road etc. I like the styling of the pre59s but they are quite expensive. 1925 Buick 29 57 Via Doyoulikevintage The Classic Car Feed Classic And Antique Cars Doyoulikevintage Decem Antique Cars Classic Cars Classic Cars Vintage.</p>
